Find a way so we don't have to repeat to send the same variables to the template over and over again. 
The current state:
	confirmation = ""
	error = ""
	dranken = Dranken.query.all()
	...
	return render_template('page.html', confirmation=confirmation, error=error, dranken=dranken, ...)
Possible improvement:
	vars = {}
	vars['confirmation'] = ""
	vars['error'] = ""
	vars['dranken'] = Dranken.query.all()
	...
	render_template('page.html', **vars)

Only write to DB and display a confirmation for ids for which the value we received in the POST does not equal the value in the DB

write the values POSTed to stock_aanpassen to DB

add items POSTed to stock_toevoegen to DB
