Functionality
    add filtering to tables that need it
        bar log
        cash log
    add pages 'dagboek' and 'kasboek'
    add notifications
    add an api vwcr can hook into
    add active field for stock items instead of removing them
    do some validation on uploaded files
    add uploading of attachments to add_transactions and edit transaction
    make script to translate an SQL dump from MALMan1 into a format understood by MALMan2
    have a fancy lightbox to show attachments
    have a decent error page for RequestEntityTooLarge
        use flask built in limiter:
            app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024
    add the possibility to select members in a transactions 'to/from' field

Refactoring
    check the way users are activated: active, actief_lid, membership role
    check the way forms are initialized and fields are dynamically set
    remove unused code from flask_security/ (~2000 of ~3000 LOC are in here)
    Minimize the number of times we read from the DB
    Minimize the number of times we write to the DB (db.session.commit())
        sometimes we do this multiple times in a view, because we need an the id of a row we are writting
    check validity of XHTML, CSS & JS
    fix whitespace in produced XHTML
    somehow the textarea tag around the motivation field is sent along and written to the DB. these tags are then stripped in the view by using the striptag filter. This doesn't happen when using the TextAreaField outside flask_security
    clean up database.py
        do we need __repr__ and __str__?

Bugs
    permissions and user email are saved in user session. this is only written on login. Therefore users will need to log out and log back in to see the change.
    if a reimbursement is filed without a reimbursement_date we don't know it was a reimbursement request anymore, and so can't know it still has to be reimbursed
    we don't save whom a user payed when he files a reimbursement request

Usability
    improve graphical design
        use symbolic icons
    add a red border around an input element that doesn't validate
    print the active category in bold, this is easy to see where you are

Deployment
    forms checklist:
        redirect after a POST (to prevent data from being submitted twice if users refresh the page)
        use all necessary validators
        use if form.validate_on_submit():
        templates don't define their own input elements
        use functions to process booleans
        use add_confirmation()
    serve it as a wsgi appliation
    serve static files from without MALMan

Might be cool:
    add validator to check if a new stock item name is unique
    (accept both commas or periods on decimal fields)
